Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

   - [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
